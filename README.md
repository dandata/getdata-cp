## Processing and analysis procedure
There are two datasets for data â€“ train and test. For each dataset data was taken from X\_train.txt and X\_test.txt files respectively. Each dataset was subsetted only for mean and standart deviation columns. After that each dataset was merged with coressponding subject and activity. Before this merge activity was merged with its labels. After all train and test datasets were merged in one big dataset.

Merged dataset was aggregated by subject and activity taking each variable mean. Column names have been prettied to look nice and to be relevant with its content.
